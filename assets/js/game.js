                                ***********************                     two ways to declare a function
    Function Declaration
Function declaration: This is when we create a function using the function keyword first. 
The following code shows an example:

// create function
function fight() {
  window.alert("Welcome to Robot Gladiators!");
}
// execute function
fight();

    Function Expression
Function expression: This is when we create a function by assigning it to a variable. 
The following code shows an example:

// create function
var fight = function() {
  window.alert("Welcome to Robot Gladiators!");
};
// execute function
fight();
